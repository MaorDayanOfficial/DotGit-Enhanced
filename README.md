# DotGit Enhanced

**Detect. Download. Extract.** — The first browser extension that automatically finds exposed `.git` repositories on websites you visit, downloads the objects, and **reconstructs the actual source code** — all in one click.

## 💡 Why This Exists

Security researchers typically need **three separate tools** to go from discovery to source code:

1. A **finder** to detect exposed `.git` on a website
2. A **dumper** to download the raw Git objects
3. An **extractor** to reconstruct actual files from those objects

**DotGit Enhanced merges all three steps into a single browser extension.** Click the download button, and you get a ZIP containing the reconstructed source files — ready to analyze.

## ✨ What It Does

### 🔎 Auto-Detection (Passive Scanning)
Silently checks every website you visit for exposed sensitive files:

| Target | What It Finds | Default |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **`.git/`** | Full Git repository — source code, history, credentials | ✅ On |
| **`.svn/`** | Subversion database (`wc.db`) | ⬚ Off |
| **`.hg/`** | Mercurial manifest data | ⬚ Off |
| **`.env`** | API keys, database passwords, secrets | ⬚ Off |
| **`.DS_Store`** | macOS file/folder metadata leaks | ⬚ Off |
| **`security.txt`** | Responsible disclosure contact info | ✅ On |

### 📦 One-Click Download + Extraction
When you click download on a `.git` finding:

```
Step 1: DISCOVER  →  Check for directory listing, fetch 50+ well-known Git paths
Step 2: CRAWL     →  Parse refs, logs, packed-refs to find every branch & object
Step 3: DOWNLOAD  →  Fetch all Git objects with smart connection pooling
Step 4: EXTRACT   →  Decompress objects, traverse commit→tree→blob chains
Step 5: DELIVER   →  ZIP with both raw .git data AND reconstructed source files
```

The resulting ZIP contains:

```
website_com.zip
├── website_com_source/          ← ✅ Actual source files (index.html, app.js, etc.)
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── database.yml
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── app.js
│   └── ...
├── website_com_raw_git/         ← Raw .git objects (for manual analysis)
│   ├── HEAD
│   ├── config
│   ├── objects/
│   └── ...
├── ExtractionReport.txt         ← What was found, extracted, or failed
└── DownloadStats.txt            ← HTTP status codes breakdown
```

### 🛡️ Intelligence Features
- **Open Source Check** — Reads `.git/config` to find GitHub/GitLab remote URLs
- **security.txt Detection** — Finds responsible disclosure policies
- **Dynamic Ref Discovery** — Scans downloaded files for branch names not in any static list
- **Directory Listing Detection** — If the server exposes file listings, crawls recursively for maximum coverage

### 🎨 Modern Dark UI
- Stats dashboard with type breakdowns
- Color-coded badges (green `.git`, amber `.env`, blue `.svn`)
- Animated findings list with hover-reveal actions
- Card-based settings with toggle switches
- Desktop notifications for findings and download progress

## 🎯 How the Download & Extraction Engine Works

This is the core innovation — combining three workflows into one:

### Phase 1: Smart Discovery
Before fetching individual objects, the engine checks if `/.git/` returns an HTML directory listing. If it does, it **recursively crawls the entire tree** via link parsing — the fastest possible method. This technique is inspired by [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper).

### Phase 2: Expanded Path Fetching
If no directory listing exists, the engine fetches from **50+ well-known Git paths** covering:
- Common branches: `master`, `main`, `staging`, `production`, `development`, `dev`
- All remote origin refs for each branch
- WIP refs (used by git-wip and emacs magit)
- Log files for every ref
- Git hooks (may reveal custom scripts)

### Phase 3: Dynamic Ref Discovery
After the initial files land, the engine **scans their content** for additional ref paths. If `packed-refs` mentions `refs/heads/feature-payments`, that ref and its logs are automatically fetched too. This catches custom branch names that no static list would find — inspired by git-dumper's `FindRefsWorker`.

### Phase 4: Object Crawling
All discovered SHA-1 hashes are resolved to objects. Tree objects are decompressed with Pako (zlib) and traversed recursively to discover every reachable object.

### Phase 5: Source Extraction *(new — inspired by [GitTools Extractor](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools))*
Once all objects are downloaded, the engine:
1. Finds every **commit** object
2. Reads the commit's **tree** hash
3. Recursively traverses the tree: directories become folders, blobs become files
4. Decompresses each blob to recover the **actual file content** with its **original filename**
5. Writes everything into the `_source/` folder in the ZIP

If extraction fails (e.g., pack-only repo, missing objects), the raw `.git` data is still included with a detailed `ExtractionReport.txt` explaining what happened and what to try next.

### Phase 6: ZIP Delivery
Everything is packaged with JSZip and downloaded through the browser.

### Connection Queue

```
Concurrent requests ≤ max_connections
       │
       ├── capacity available → fetch immediately
       └── at capacity → wait(pending × wait_ms), capped at max_wait_ms
```

| Preset | Connections | Wait | Max Wait | Max Failures |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Conservative | 5 | 200ms | 20s | 100 |
| **Default** | **20** | **100ms** | **10s** | **250** |
| Aggressive | 50 | 50ms | 5s | 500 |

> ⚠️ Aggressive settings may freeze your browser. All processing happens in RAM.
